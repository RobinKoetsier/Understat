# Understat
Repo for scraping and plotting Understat data

There is an easy way to plot expected goal timelines and shotmaps yourself. Understat.com provides data of all shots in a game and their xG value. In some easy steps we will:

[- Install Understatr and tidy data](#install-understatr-and-tidy-data)

[- Inspect and modify the data](#inspect-and-modify-the-data)

[- Plot an xG shotmap](#plot-an-xg-shotmap)

**- Plot an xG timeline**

I will assume that you have at least some knowledge with R and already have some packages installed. If not, start by searching info and tutorials about R and RStudio. 

# Install Understatr and get data

Download the Understatr package from [https://github.com/ewenme/understatr](https://github.com/ewenme/understatr) and load it along with the tidyverse

```
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, understatr)
```

Understatr has a few functions, see:
