# Understat
Repo for scraping and plotting Understat data
[Go to Real Cool Heading section](#real-cool-heading)
There is an easy way to plot expected goal timelines and shotmaps yourself. Understat.com provides data of all shots in a game and their xG value. In some easy steps we will:

**- Install understatr and get the data**

**- Inspect and modify the data**

**- Plot a shotmap**

**- Plot an xG timeline**

I will assume that you have at least some knowledge with R and already have some packages installed. If not, start by searching info and tutorials about R and RStudio.
